How does the PCA0 PWM0 output works ??

In AUXR5 there is a C0PS0 bit to set the PCA0 output ie -
to change PCA0 out from CEX0 which is channeled by default throught the P2.2 Pin
Then there are the PWM0A and PWM0B pins which are P1.6 and P1.7 respectively These are for advanced PWM control ig
But of course there is another register to set the channel of these pins and another register to turn these on or off
So igonring the "SUB CHANNELS" and focusing on the "MAIN CHANNELS" the P2.2 or the CEX0 pin has to be the PCA0 PWM0 output
The register to turn PWM0 on or off is the PAOE bit 0 or the POE0 bit You wont find the reference to this register in the code 
as the default is enabled

Looked for a widely used MCU to confirm seems like this is the right port

# P2.2 HAS TO BE THE PWM OUTPUT
# P1.5 IS THE LED OUTPUT
# P1.7 IS THE ON OFF SWITCH
# P2.4 IS THE FEEDBACK IN
